>Abstract
---
  The system basically takes an input expression (currently based on _Operator Precedence_ only) and gives a step by step guidance on solving the problems. It generates a sharable link that can be used by two different users to solve that problem simultaneously. It provides an AI assistant that generates hint based on the current situation.
  The system stores the previous solved problems by the user, accounting the time taken and hardness of the problem. Using this information the user may browse the problems.
  The system allows the users to add partners and may recommend and share problems with them.
